# CompARE-package

# Description 

The CompARE package contains five key functions:

- *prob_cbe* to compute the probability of a composite binary endpoint;   
- *lower_corr* to compute the lower bound of Pearson's correlation; 
- *upper_corr* to compute the upper bound for Pearson's correlation; 
- *effectsize_cbe* to compute the treatment effect on the composite binary endpoint;
- *samplesize_cbe* to compute the sample size for composite binary endpoint; 
- *ARE_cbe* to compute the ARE method for composite binary endpoint.
