Description: It includes a set of functions of great use in studies where the study variable is combined.
            It has mainly been designed to calculate the large sample required in any assay.
            with combined variables.
            In addition, it allows to calculate different statistical measures of great use in the clinical 
            field as the odds rati, the relative risk or the difference in proportions, as well as the 
            confidence interval on the correlation is established of the combined variable.
            Some numerical values, such as the probability of the union of two primary events or the confidence 
            bands on which the Pearson correlation of all variable combined is established, can also be calculated 
            using functions of the same package.
