\title{SAMPLE SIZE FOR COMPOSITE BINARY ENDPOINT}
\usage{
sample_size_ce(p0_e1, p0_e2, p1_e1, p1_e2, effect_ce = "diff", rho,
  alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.2, unpooled = "unpooled Variance")
}
\arguments{
\item{p0_e1}{numeric parameter, probability of occurrence E1 by the control group}

\item{p0_e2}{numeric parameter, probability of occurrence E2 by the control group}

\item{p1_e1}{numeric parameter, probability of occurrence E1 by the intervention group}

\item{p1_e2}{numeric parameter, probability of occurrence E2 by the intervention group}

\item{effect_ce}{Effect to measure the sample size}

\item{rho}{numeric parameter, correlation of pearson between two events E1 and E2}

\item{alpha}{level of confidencea alpha}

\item{beta}{level of confidence beta}

\item{unpooled}{Variance class used in the calculation of the sample size}
}
\value{
Return the sample size for composite binary endpoints based on the anticipated values of the composite components
and the association between them in terms of Pearson's correlation.
}
\description{
This function calculates the value of the sample size according to its input parameters.
}
\details{
The entry parameters representing the probability of the events taking place are limited between 0 and 1,
 without including both values. Pearson's correlation must be within the confidence interval allowed
 by the combined variable according to the probabilities given. To calculate this confidence interval you can use lower_corr and upper_corr functions
 that you can find in this package. By default, if the type of effect
 with which the resulting large sample is to be associated is not specified,
 the difference in proportions is used. When specifying the levels of alpha and beta meaning,
 they may not be higher than 1, as well as the following type of variance that is desired to be used
 in the calculation of the sample size.
